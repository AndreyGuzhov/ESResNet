# Ignite Trainer

Ignite Trainer is a framework built on top of [PyTorch Ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite) and [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom).
It was developed to wrap training and logging of PyTorch models. 
The development is frozen due to the switch to [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning).
